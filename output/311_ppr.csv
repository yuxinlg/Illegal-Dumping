Describe the issue: I take my 4year old son and 3 year old daughter with autism to this park and more so in the summer with the sprinkler-dragon. However, lately the amount of trash, cigarette butts and yes even a syringe was found by me as I walked around the park with my kids. This is close to us and would love to revisit. But having a special needs child means a cleaner environment. The weeds and bushes are overgrown with trash is shoved inside them. The fences are busted and the grass and weeds are overgrown. I understand the community needs to clean up after themselves but I have cleaned up each time I?ve been there and can only do so much.

I am a father of 4 kids.i take my kids to the park near William. H. Loesche elementary school 19116. Today is the second time I noticed an old man coming with his dog. He untie the dog and let him go around freely in the park .i understand it's  a trained dog but we have little kids playing in the park .I feel it's not safe  and also I observed the dog poop near the park light on the grass between 8:45- 9:15 am, till I left the park the poop was not picked up. Small kids play around at this time so they may not observe and can step into it which can be harmful for their health .just wanted let to know our concerns. If there is anything you can do please consider.

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring your attention to the deteriorating condition of the tennis courts at Northwood Park. As a regular visitor to the park, I have noticed several issues that urgently require attention:
Faded Court Surfaces: The tennis court surfaces have faded significantly, affecting gameplay and safety.
Garbage Accumulation: The courts are littered with trash, making it unpleasant for players and visitors alike.
Rodent Odor: There is a noticeable smell of rodents around the courts, which is both unsightly and concerning.
Additionally, I would like to highlight the need for benches near the tennis courts. Having benches would provide a comfortable waiting area for players awaiting their turn on the court.
Given the popularity of Northwood Park and its importance to the community, I kindly request that you allocate resources to address these issues promptly. Proper maintenance and revitalization of the tennis courts would greatly enhance the overall park experience.
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",40.0227693,-75.0927935,5008Y00002PYtfJ,,2024,POINT (492081.8056082713 4430288.516676149)

I hope this email finds you well.

I am once again writing to bring to your attention the deteriorating condition of the tennis courts at Northwood Park. This is my second attempt to reach the Parks and Recreation team regarding these concerns, and I would greatly appreciate an update or some form of confirmation on this request.

As a regular visitor to the park, I have noticed several issues that urgently require attention:

  *   Faded Court Surfaces: The tennis court surfaces have faded significantly, affecting both gameplay and safety.
  *   Garbage Accumulation: The courts are littered with trash, making them unpleasant for players and visitors alike.
  *   Rodent Odor: There is a noticeable odor of rodents around the courts, which is both unsightly and concerning.

Additionally, I would like to highlight the need for benches near the tennis courts. Having benches would provide a comfortable waiting area for players awaiting their turn on the court.

Given the popularity of Northwood Park and its importance to the community, I kindly request that you allocate resources to address these issues promptly. Proper maintenance and revitalization of the tennis courts would greatly enhance the overall park experience.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,",40.0219216,-75.0928883,500VI00000DkW8g,,2024,POINT (492073.61810258613 4430194.438311783)

The recent Vendemia foundation event (Sat, Sept 14) left trash on site at Stephen Girard Park in the area where the food vendor was located. 

Specifically, there are jars/bottles of waste oil and grease as well as other boxes from the food concession area left behind and on the North side of the park.

I have called and left messages for the foundation since Sunday but no one has responded and the trash is still there for animals to start tearing into.

Please contact the foundation and/or food vendor to have this cleaned up or send a team down from the commission to clean it up and then bill the foundation.

As well, the park could use - like Rittenhouse - a clean up of the grass and flower beds come fall. Can we schedule that, please?

 THIS REPORT IS TO THE TWO ISSUES AT THE SAME LOCATION!

HERE ARE OF THE TWO ISSUES:

1. BROKEN -SIDE-WALK!

2. FREE AND UNCULTIVATED (UNINHABIT 
ED) LAND!

TO BEGIN, THE GROSS STREET SIDE-WALK THAT IS IN BETWEEN OF THE ARCH STREET THROUGH RACE STREET IS CRACKED AND BROKEN AND PUBLICLY HAZARDOUS!

SECONDLY, THE FREE OR OPEN LAND THAT IS NEXT TO THE GROSS STREET SIDE-WALK NEEDS TO BE CLEANED AND INSPECTED FOR THE POSSIBLE USAGE OF THE PRODUCTION OF HOUSES THAT IS SUITABLE FOR THIS COMMUNITY!

IN CONCLUSION, THIS STORY IS TO THE CONCERN FOR THE DANGEROUS AND BROKEN SIDE-WALK, AND THE POSSIBLE USAGE OF THE OPEN AND FREE LAND THAT CAN BE POSSIBLELY USED TO THE BUILDING OF MORE HOMES FOR THE CITIZENS OF THE CITY!

IMPORATANT, HERE IS OF THE LOCATION:

THE GROSS STREET  SIDE-WALK THAT IS IN BETWEEN OF THE ARCH STREET THROUGH RACE STREET, WHICH IS NEXT TO THE COBBS CREEK PARK EXTENSION!
